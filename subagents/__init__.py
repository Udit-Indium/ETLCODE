"""Pipeline sub-agents.

Two side effects on import, both deliberate and both order-sensitive.

**1. `.env` is loaded explicitly, by path.** The agent modules each call a bare
`load_dotenv()`, which searches upward from the CALLER's directory for a file
named `.env` — a search that never finds this project's file. Verified:
`find_dotenv()` returns nothing even when called from inside this package, so
every one of those calls was a no-op and `DATABRICKS_HOST`, `DATABRICKS_API_KEY`
and the rate-limit quotas were silently missing.

Both plausible locations are tried, because `.env.example` ships at the repo
root while the code originally read only `subagents/.env` — so copying the
example where it sits produced a file nothing loaded. Whichever exists wins;
if both do, the more specific `subagents/.env` takes precedence, and a real
environment variable beats either (`override=False`), which is what CI and
container deployments expect.

**2. The LiteLLM rate limiter is installed.** It lives here rather than in the
top-level entrypoint because every agent module is `subagents.something`, so
Python imports THIS file before any of them can be reached, whichever entrypoint
is used. The patch must be in place before an agent is constructed.

The `.env` load comes first: the limiter reads its quotas from the environment,
so loading afterwards would leave the buckets on their defaults.
