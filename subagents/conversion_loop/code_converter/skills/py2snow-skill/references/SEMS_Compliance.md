# SEMS Compliance Conventions

**SEMS** = Software Engineering & Maintainability Standards (BRD FR-03 / FR-04).
Every converted PySpark file must be **readable, traceable, secure, and
maintainable**. These are the code-quality rules the converted output is graded
on, independent of whether the logic is correct (that is the ETL conventions'
job).

A converted file passes SEMS only if **all** of the following hold. Each rule has
a ✅ to follow and a ❌ to avoid.

---

## 1. Docstrings — every function and class

- **Every** function (top-level and nested) and **every** class has a docstring.
- The docstring states: what it does, its parameters, what it returns, and — for
  traceability — the **source function it was converted from** and any
  divergence (e.g. "uses `percentile_approx`, approximate vs pandas `qcut`").
- If the source function already had a docstring (see `parsed["functions"][].docstring`),
  **carry its intent over** and extend it; do not drop it.
- **The module itself has a top-level docstring** with `Inputs:` and `Outputs:`
  sections naming every Delta table / file the module reads and writes, plus
  the execution context (`DOC001`) — required for STAM lineage audits.
- **Every documented parameter appears under an `Args:` section** (`DOC002`)
  and **every function that returns or yields a value has a `Returns:` /
  `Yields:` section** (`DOC003`). `@property`/`@cached_property` getters are
  exempt from `Returns:` — the summary line describes the value directly.

✅ **Follow — module docstring:**
```python
"""Pipeline: customer_analytics ETL

Inputs:
  - Delta table: raw.customer_transactions
  - Delta table: raw.fx_rates

Outputs:
  - Delta table: curated.customer_analytics

Execution: Databricks STAM
"""
```

✅ **Follow — function docstring:**
```python
def convert_to_usd(transactions: DataFrame, fx_rates: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """Convert each transaction amount to USD using the latest prior FX rate.

    Converted from `convert_to_usd` in customer_analytics_pipeline.py. The pandas
    `merge_asof` (nearest prior rate) is reproduced with a window + F.last over
    rates filtered to on-or-before the txn date — see ETL conventions §5.

    Args:
        transactions: txn frame with `txn_timestamp`, `currency`, `amount`.
        fx_rates:      rates frame with `currency`, `effective_date`, `rate_to_usd`.
    Returns:
        `transactions` plus an `amount_usd` column.
    """
```
❌ **Avoid:** no docstring, or a useless one:
```python
def convert_to_usd(transactions, fx_rates):
    # converts to usd
    ...
```

---

## 2. Inline comments + source mapping (traceability)

- One comment per **non-trivial** transformation explaining *what & why*.
- Carry the source's block tags through. If the source has `# [T07] convert to USD`,
  the converted block keeps `# [T07] convert to USD -> window + F.last`. If the
  parsed JSON gives a function `tag`, use it.
- Comment the **divergence traps** explicitly at the site (null ordering,
  explode_outer, percentile_approx, etc.).
- Do **not** over-comment trivial lines (`# create spark session`) — comment
  intent, not syntax.

✅ **Follow:**
```python
# [T12] flag velocity fraud: >=3 txns within a 60s window per customer
w = Window.partitionBy("customer_id").orderBy(F.col("txn_ts").cast("long"))
out = out.withColumn(
    "has_velocity_flag",
    F.count("*").over(w.rangeBetween(-CONFIG["fraud_velocity_window_seconds"], 0))
     >= CONFIG["fraud_velocity_count_threshold"],
)
```
❌ **Avoid:** unexplained magic, no source mapping:
```python
out = out.withColumn("has_velocity_flag", F.count("*").over(w.rangeBetween(-60, 0)) >= 3)
```
(hardcoded literals instead of `CONFIG`, no `[Txx]` tag, no explanation.)

---

## 3. Naming standards

- **Keep the source's function, parameter, and output-column names verbatim** —
  this is what makes the conversion auditable. Do not rename `out` to `result_df`
  or `customer_id` to `cust_id`.
- Module-level constants stay `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (`CONFIG`, `REQUIRED_TXN_COLS`).
- Functions/variables stay `lower_snake_case`. Classes stay `PascalCase`.
- No single-letter names except conventional loop/lambda bounds; mirror whatever
  the source used so columns trace 1:1.
- **Delta table identifiers follow `<domain>_<entity>_<layer>`**, e.g.
  `trading_position_raw`, `hr_employee_curated` (`SHELL_NAME001`) — this
  applies wherever the converted code **names a table**:
  `spark.read.table(...)`, `spark.table(...)`, `df.writeTo(...)`,
  `df.write.saveAsTable(...)`, `df.write.insertInto(...)`,
  `DeltaTable.forName(...)`. If the source's table name doesn't fit the
  pattern and the correct domain/layer isn't derivable from context, keep the
  source name as-is and call it out in the final manual-intervention list
  (STEP 8) instead of guessing — do **not** leave a `TODO`/`FIXME` comment in
  the code (that itself trips `COM001`).
  This governs **table names only** — columns, functions, and parameters
  still stay verbatim per the rule above.

✅ **Follow:** `def normalize_strings(customers: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:` with an
output column `customer_hash` exactly as the source named it.

❌ **Avoid:** `def norm(c):` returning `cust_hash` — breaks traceability and the
column-name contract from the parsed JSON.

---

## 4. Logging, not print

- Use the `logging` module (`logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`); log at
  block/function boundaries (`logger.info("…")`, `logger.warning("…")`).
- **Never** use `print` for pipeline logging. (The source's `logger.info`/
  `logger.warning` calls map straight across.)
- No noisy per-row logging — that forces materialization and kills performance.

✅ `logger.warning("Found %d unknown currencies; coercing to NaN", n_unknown)`
❌ `print("done converting")`

---

## 5. Error handling & try/except discipline

- **Wrap operations that can genuinely fail at runtime** in `try/except`: external
  reads/writes, `spark.createDataFrame` on synthetic data, type casts that can
  raise, schema validation, and any external lookup/broadcast. Pure lazy DataFrame
  transforms do not each need a try/except (the exception surfaces at the action).
- **Catch SPECIFIC exceptions**, never a bare `except:` and never a blanket
  `except Exception` that hides the cause. Prefer the narrowest type
  (`AnalysisException`, `ValueError`, `KeyError`, `Py4JJavaError`, a domain
  `PipelineError`).
- **Never swallow**: an `except` block must do one of — re-raise, raise a
  domain exception `from exc`, or log at `error`/`warning` and take a defined
  fallback. No `except: pass`, no empty body, no silent `return None`.
- **Preserve the cause**: use `raise PipelineError(...) from exc` so the original
  traceback is retained.
- **Log with context** inside the handler (which function, which input), then act.
- **Raise the same exception types the source raises, where it raised them**
  (e.g. a `PipelineError` from `validate_schema`). Carry custom exception classes
  over verbatim.
- Use `finally` (or a context manager) for cleanup that must always run.

✅ **Follow — validate-and-raise (guard clause):**
```python
missing = set(required_cols) - set(df.columns)
if missing:
    raise PipelineError(f"{name} missing required columns: {sorted(missing)}")
```
✅ **Follow — specific catch, log, re-raise preserving cause:**
```python
try:
    df = spark.read.parquet(path)
except AnalysisException as exc:
    logger.error("Failed to read input for %s at %s: %s", name, path, exc)
    raise PipelineError(f"could not read {name} from {path}") from exc
```
❌ **Avoid — swallowing / broad catch (SonarQube: python:S5754 / S1181):**
```python
try:
    validate(df)
except:            # bare except — forbidden
    pass           # swallows data-quality failures the source surfaces
```
❌ **Avoid — blanket catch that hides the real error:**
```python
try:
    return build(df)
except Exception:
    return None     # silent failure; caller can't tell what broke
```

---

## 6. Security — no hardcoded secrets

- No hardcoded credentials, tokens, absolute secret paths, JDBC passwords, or
  connection strings anywhere in the converted file.
- Configuration stays in `CONFIG` / parameters; secrets come from the runtime
  (e.g. Databricks secret scopes / widgets), never inlined.
- **This overrides "carry constants verbatim" elsewhere in this skill.** A
  module-level constant whose name or value is a credential (`PASSWORD`,
  `TOKEN`, `API_KEY`, `SECRET`, an embedded-password connection string) is
  the one case where verbatim carry-over from the source is wrong — replace
  its value with `dbutils.secrets.get(scope=..., key=...)` even though every
  other constant is kept byte-for-byte identical to the source.

❌ **Avoid:** `spark.read.jdbc(url="jdbc:...;password=Pa55w0rd", ...)`
✅ **Follow:** read connection details from injected config/secret references.

---

## 7. Modularity & structure

- One function = one transformation, mirroring the source's boundaries. No
  mega-functions that fuse several source functions together.
- Keep nested helpers nested (do not hoist `_fill` out of `impute_nulls`) — the
  structure must mirror the source so the original call order still maps.
- Imports at the top, grouped (stdlib, third-party, local). `CONFIG` and module
  constants near the top.

---

## 8. SonarQube-style static-quality rules (clean code)

The output is scanned by a SonarQube-style linter. Each converted function must
pass these (the SonarQube rule id is noted for reference):

- **Type hints (python:S...):** every parameter and the return are annotated —
  `def f(df: DataFrame, threshold: float = 0.0) -> DataFrame:`.
- **No commented-out code (python:S125):** never leave dead/commented-out code
  (`# out = df.filter(...)`). Delete it; comments explain *why*, not old code.
- **No dead / unreachable code (python:S1763):** no code after a `return`/`raise`;
  no `if False:` blocks; no unused branches.
- **No unused imports or variables (python:S1128 / python:S1481):** import only
  what you use; don't assign a variable you never read.
- **No leftover TODO/FIXME (python:S1135) or stubs:** no `# TODO`, `...`, `pass`
  placeholder bodies, or `# continue similarly`. Every function is fully
  implemented.
- **No magic literals (python:S109 / S1192):** business numbers/strings come from
  `CONFIG` or named constants, not inlined (`CONFIG["threshold"]`, not `250.0`).
  A repeated string literal (≥3×) becomes a named constant.
- **Manageable complexity (python:S3776 cognitive complexity):** keep functions
  focused; extract a nested helper rather than deeply nesting `when`/`if` chains.
  Avoid functions longer than ~60 lines (`STYLE001`). Decision nesting, fan-out,
  and expression-term count each have exact bands — see §9 and `SKILL.md`'s
  "Structural complexity" rules.
- **No bare/broad except (python:S5754 / S1181):** see §5.
- **Boolean/return clarity (python:S1125):** no `== True`, no redundant
  `if x: return True else: return False` — return the expression.
- **Consistent returns (python:S3516):** a function that returns a `DataFrame`
  returns one on every path (no accidental `None`).

✅ **Follow:**
```python
HIGH_VALUE_THRESHOLD = CONFIG["high_value_threshold"]  # named, from CONFIG

def filter_high_value_orders(df: DataFrame, threshold: float = HIGH_VALUE_THRESHOLD) -> DataFrame:
    """Keep non-null orders above `threshold`. Converted from filter_high_value_orders."""
    return df.filter((F.col("amount") > threshold) & F.col("amount").isNotNull())
```
❌ **Avoid:** untyped, magic literal, dead comment, `== True`:
```python
def filter_high_value_orders(df, threshold=250.0):
    # df = df.dropna()   # <- commented-out dead code
    return df.filter((F.col("amount") > threshold) == True)
```

## 9. Code readability & structure — SEMS BRD area

SEMS scores every file against 5 BRD areas; **"Code readability and structure"**
is one of them (`sems_validator.py: BRD_AREAS`) and is the area most often
responsible for a high blocking count on a freshly converted file. Some of its
rules are covered in full above — cross-referenced, not repeated — the rest
are new here.

- **Module docstring `Inputs:`/`Outputs:`** — §1 (`DOC001`).
- **`Args:` / `Returns:`/`Yields:` sections** — §1 (`DOC002`, `DOC003`).
- **Table names `<domain>_<entity>_<layer>`** — §3 (`SHELL_NAME001`).
- **No magic literals, no TODO/FIXME, no commented-out code** — §8 (`LIT001`,
  `LIT002`, `COM001`, `COM002`).
- **Boolean functions named as a question, empty statements commented** — see
  `SKILL.md`'s own SEMS clean-code rules (`FUNC001`, `STMT001`).
- **Cloud/DBFS paths only** (`SPARK009`): never write a local filesystem path
  (`/home/...`, `/tmp/...`, `/var/...`, `C:\...`). Use a DBFS path
  (`/dbfs/mnt/...`) or a cloud URI (`s3://...`, `abfss://...`) — carry over
  whatever the source config specifies; never invent a local path.
- **Expression term count ≤ 5** (`EXPR001`): a boolean/comparison chain with
  6–8 terms needs justification, 9+ is a hard blocker. Break it into named
  sub-expressions or helper predicates rather than one long chain.

  ✅
  ```python
  is_high_risk = amount > MAX_AMOUNT
  is_flagged = is_high_risk and is_new_customer and not is_verified
  ```
  ❌
  ```python
  if amount > MAX_AMOUNT and is_new and not verified and country in RISKY and score < 0.2 and retries > 3:
  ```

- **No unrelated parameter reassignment** (`PARAM001`): never overwrite a
  parameter with a value unrelated to its input.

  ❌ `def apply_threshold(threshold: float) -> float:` then `threshold = 100.0`
  ✅ `def apply_threshold(threshold: float) -> float:` then `effective_threshold = 100.0`

  A self-derived chain such as `df = df.filter(...)` is idiomatic and is
  **not** flagged.
- **No dead `self.x` attributes** (`ATTR001`): every instance attribute
  assigned in a class must be read somewhere in that class body. Don't carry
  over a `self.x = ...` the converted class never reads.
- **No unused imports** (flake8 `F401` / pylint `unused-import`): import only
  a name you actually reference somewhere in the file. Do **not** defensively
  import `typing` helpers (`Optional`, `List`, `Dict`, `Union`, `Any`, …) "in
  case they're needed" — add one only when a type hint in this file actually
  uses it. Before finishing the file, walk the import block top to bottom and
  confirm every single imported name is used at least once elsewhere in the
  file; delete any name that isn't (partial-use is not enough — `from typing
  import Optional, List` with only `List` used still needs `Optional` removed).
- **Formatting & lint hygiene** (`black` / `isort` / `flake8` / `pylint` /
  `pydocstyle` — all scored under this BRD area): 4-space indentation, imports
  grouped stdlib → third-party → local and alphabetised within each group, no
  unused variables, docstrings in a single consistent style (the Google-style
  `Args:`/`Returns:` used throughout this doc), no needlessly long lines.

---

## SEMS checklist (must all hold)

- [ ] Every function & class has a meaningful docstring naming its source function.
- [ ] Module docstring has `Inputs:`/`Outputs:` sections; every function's docstring has `Args:` and, where it returns/yields, `Returns:`/`Yields:`.
- [ ] Non-trivial transforms commented; source `[Txx]`/tags carried through; divergence traps commented.
- [ ] Function / parameter / column / class names kept **verbatim** from the source + parsed JSON; table identifiers follow `<domain>_<entity>_<layer>`.
- [ ] Type hints on every parameter and return.
- [ ] No local filesystem paths — DBFS or cloud URIs only.
- [ ] Boolean/comparison chains ≤ 5 terms; no unrelated parameter reassignment; no dead `self.x` attributes.
- [ ] Imports grouped/sorted, consistent formatting, no unused imports/vars — lint-clean.
- [ ] `logging` used throughout; **no** `print`; no per-row logging.
- [ ] Risky ops wrapped in `try/except` with a SPECIFIC exception, logged, and re-raised (`from exc`) or a defined fallback; **no** bare/broad `except`, **no** `except: pass`.
- [ ] Same exception types raised at the same points as the source.
- [ ] **No** hardcoded secrets / credentials / connection strings — including
      constants that were literal in the source; replaced with
      `dbutils.secrets.get(...)`.
- [ ] **No** commented-out code, dead code, unused imports/vars, TODO/FIXME, or placeholder bodies.
- [ ] **No** magic literals — business values come from `CONFIG` / named constants.
- [ ] Functions are focused (cognitive complexity, length, nesting kept low).
- [ ] Modular structure mirrors the source; nested helpers stay nested; imports grouped.
