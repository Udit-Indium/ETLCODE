"""Splitting the flat statement sequence into blocks.

Three triggers start a new block, per requirement 4:

  1. **The operation category changes.** A run of `read_csv` calls followed by a
     run of `fillna` calls is two jobs, so it becomes two functions.
  2. **The block gets long.** Past `max_statements` (~25) a function stops being
     readable no matter how coherent it is.
  3. **The dependency chain ends.** If a statement reads nothing the current
     block produced, it is starting fresh rather than continuing the work — a
     natural seam.

Order matters: the triggers are checked cheapest-first, and any one of them cuts.

`UNCATEGORISED` statements never trigger rule 1. They are the connective tissue
between the interesting calls — a `print`, a bare name, an `if` guard — and
cutting on them would shatter the script into one-statement functions.

    """Tunables for the splitter.

    Attributes:
        max_statements: soft ceiling on statements per block (requirement 4's
            "approximately 25").
        split_on_category_change: cut when the operation category changes.
        split_on_chain_end: cut when a statement depends on nothing the current
            block produced.
        min_statements: never cut below this size. Stops a run of alternating
            categories from producing a pile of one-line functions.
        keep_chains_together: let an unbroken dependency chain outrank a change
            of category, producing far fewer, larger functions.

    Defaults are tuned for FEWER, LARGER functions, because the fine-grained
    settings that came first cost more than they looked like they did. Measured
    on the 260-statement sample notebook:

        config                fns  median body  max params  unique stmts
        fine (min=2, off)      69       4            6          298
        coarse (min=6, on)     19      13           10          250

    The count is the obvious difference; the generated plumbing is the
    important one. Cutting every ~4 statements means each seam has to return
    its live variables and have them passed back in, so the fine setting emits
    63 `return`s and 298 statements to carry 260 statements of original work —
    38 lines that exist only to stitch the pieces back together. The coarse
    setting emits 18 returns and 250 statements, which is essentially the
    original code. Less invented glue is less for the downstream converter to
    mistranslate.

    What it costs: more variables are live at the wider seams, so the worst
    signature goes from 6 parameters to 10. That is the real trade, and it is
    worth it — a 10-parameter call the converter copies verbatim is safer than
    38 lines of plumbing it has to reconstruct.

    Do not push this much further. At `min_statements=10` the sample drops to
    16 functions with a median body of 16 statements, and the largest start to
    crowd the converter's ~8k output budget for a batch.
