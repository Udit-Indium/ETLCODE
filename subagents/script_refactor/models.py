class Statement:
    """A single top-level statement and the facts derived from its AST.

    Attributes:
        node: the AST node itself.
        source: the statement's EXACT original text, including any trailing
            same-line comment and any comment block immediately above it.
            Emitting this verbatim is what preserves both comments and
            behaviour — the alternative, `ast.unparse`, discards comments and
            silently reformats.
        category: heuristic category name (see `categories.py`).
        reads: names loaded by the statement, excluding names bound inside its
            own nested scopes (comprehensions, lambdas, nested defs).
        writes: names the statement BINDS at this level (assignment targets,
            loop targets, imports, `except ... as`, nested def/class names).
        mutates: root names mutated in place — the `df` of `df['x'] = 1` or
            `df.attr = 1`. These are reads at the language level but matter as
            outputs, because a block that mutates a frame is producing a value.
        calls: every called function name and every attribute name appearing in
            an attribute chain. Feeds both categorisation and the summary.
        roots: root identifiers of attribute chains (the `pd` of `pd.read_csv`),
            used to work out which libraries a block touches.
        header_bindings: names the statement's own header binds — the `i` of
            `for i in ...`, the `fh` of `with ... as fh`. The body reads them,
            but the statement supplies them, so they are never parameters.
