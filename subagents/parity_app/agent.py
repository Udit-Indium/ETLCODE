    an agent's run the moment a before-agent callback returns content
    (`ctx.end_invocation = True`, base_agent.py) and returns BEFORE the

    Reads pyspark_pytest.py, extracts the test functions, compares them against
    the functions_to_test list, and combines that with the pytest result.

    Escalate (stop the loop) only when BOTH hold:
      * every target function has a test  (full coverage), AND
      * a fresh Databricks pytest run of the CURRENT file exits 0 (suite passes).

    The pytest result is (re)computed HERE on the final test file rather than
    trusting whatever the agent last ran — the agent may have run the suite
    before writing all tests, or added tests after its last run, leaving a stale
    returncode in state. Re-running guarantees the verdict matches the file.

    When coverage is complete but the suite fails, we do NOT escalate — the

    """pandas idioms and local-Spark escapes in a submitted test batch.

    The converted module is distributed PySpark and _pandas_violations() rejects
    pandas in it deterministically. Nothing was doing the same for the TESTS, and
    a test suite is where an LLM reaches for pandas hardest —
    `pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(result.toPandas(), expected)` is the single
    most common way a model writes a Spark assertion.

    That is worse here than a style problem. A pandas test that fails goes to the
    code fixer, which may not edit tests and may not write pandas, so it would
    try to "repair" correct distributed code to satisfy a badly-written test, or
    make no change and spin until the loop runs out of iterations.

    Deliberately high-confidence only, and two things are NOT flagged:

    * `.collect()` — banned inside a TRANSFORM, but correct in a test. Asserting
      on a handful of rows from a small fixture frame is the whole technique.
    * numpy — fixtures are built in plain Python and handed to
      spark.createDataFrame, exactly as the converter's data-generation rule
      requires, so banning it would reject correct tests.

    There is no Excel carve-out either. Converted code gets one because xlwings
    cannot run on a cluster; a test has no reason to open a workbook at all.

        instruction="""You are an expert PySpark test engineer. You write pytest-based
    parity test cases for a converted PySpark pipeline. There is ONE non-negotiable
    rule: EVERY SINGLE FUNCTION listed below MUST have its own `test_<function_name>`
    test. Do not skip any function for any reason — a missing test is a failure.

    The converted PySpark module you are testing is importable as:
        from {pyspark_module_name} import <function_name>

    Functions you MUST write a test for (write one `test_<name>` per function):
    <functions_to_test>
    {functions_to_test}
    </functions_to_test>

    Result of the previous validation (read this — `missing_functions` lists the
    functions that STILL have no test; you MUST add a test for every one of them):
    <parity_test_status>
    {parity_test_status}
    </parity_test_status>

    THE CONVERTED MODULE IS ON DISK, NOT IN THIS PROMPT. Read only what the
    current batch needs:
      * **read_converted_index_tool()** — every function's name, parameters and
        return. Cheap; call it first to plan your batches.
      * **read_converted_functions_tool(function_names=[...])** — the real bodies
        of just the functions you are testing this turn. Assert against what the
        code actually does; never guess behaviour from a name.

    Output of the previous pytest run (if the suite failed because a TEST is
    wrong, fix the test; if it failed because the CONVERTED CODE is wrong, keep the
    correct test as-is — the code will be fixed by another agent):
    <pytest_stdout>
    {pytest_last_stdout}
    </pytest_stdout>
    <pytest_stderr>
    {pytest_last_stderr}
    </pytest_stderr>

    HOW TO WORK (batched — follow exactly):
    1. Work through `functions_to_test.names` in BATCHES of about 8-10 functions.
       For each name in the batch define a pytest function called exactly
       `test_<function_name>`. NEVER attempt the whole suite in one response: your
       output is capped at ~8k tokens, and a cut-off response loses the entire
       tool call. Call **read_converted_functions_tool** for exactly that batch to
       see what the functions really do before writing their tests.
    2. Create a shared module-scoped SparkSession fixture using plain
       `SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()` — the suite runs on Databricks, so it must
       bind to the session already present there. Do NOT call `.master("local[*]")`
       or otherwise try to start a local Spark. Build small
       in-memory DataFrames with `spark.createDataFrame(...)` for inputs. Assert on
       the real behaviour of each function — schema, row counts, and concrete values
       via `df.collect()` — based on the real body you fetched in step 1. Do not
       invent behaviour.
       THE TESTS ARE DISTRIBUTED PYSPARK TOO. The module under test contains no
       pandas and neither do its tests: no `import pandas`, no `pd.*`, no
       `.toPandas()`, no `pd.testing.assert_frame_equal`, no `.merge(...)`,
       `.iloc` or `.loc`. Compare `.collect()` rows, `df.schema` and `df.count()`
       directly — `.collect()` on a small fixture frame is correct and expected,
       converting one to pandas to compare it is not. add_pytest_tests_tool
       REJECTS a batch that breaks this, and a rejected batch is not saved.
       Building fixture rows in plain Python (including numpy) and passing them
       to `spark.createDataFrame(...)` is fine — that is the required pattern.
    3. For functions that are hard to assert directly (e.g. session builders or
       orchestrators), still write a `test_<name>` smoke test that calls the function
       and asserts it runs / returns without error.
    4. Call **add_pytest_tests_tool(tests_code=...)** with ONLY that batch. On the
       FIRST call include the imports and the SparkSession fixture as well. The tool
       merges batches by name, so nothing you sent earlier is lost — never resend a
       test that is already in the file. It returns `total_tests_in_file` and
       `test_names` so you can track progress.
    5. Repeat steps 1 and 4, batch after batch, until EVERY name in
       `functions_to_test.names` has a test. Compare `test_names` against that list
       before you finish; a missing test is a failure.
    6. You do NOT run the suite yourself and there is no tool to do so. It is run
       for you on Databricks the moment every function has a test, and its output
       comes back to you in <pytest_stdout> above. Submit your batches and stop.
    7. CRITICAL RULE: never delete, weaken, or trivialise a test just to make the
       suite pass. If a test correctly reflects the source logic but fails, leave it
       failing — that signals the converted code must be fixed elsewhere.
    8. If `parity_test_status.missing_functions` is non-empty, you did NOT cover
       them — send their `test_<name>` in a further batch.
